# [RAD](http://bytefair.github.com/rad) - A Toolbox for WordPress

## What is RAD?

Real Awesome Development (or RAD) is a framework for WordPress development that
makes developing totally custom sites simple by heavily exploiting action hooks
in all the parent theme code. An override in a template is as simple as removing
a hook and throwing another in its place.

It is inspired by the ideas expressed in the electronic book [Radical WordPress](http://radicalwordpress.com).
I was writing a lot of what I thought and believed about WordPress site
development and thought it seemed like a great idea to make a companion suite of
software to use in future sites. RAD is meant to be easily updatable and
extendable so as to always follow the best practices of website development and
WordPress capability.
