# RAD - A Toolbox for WordPress

## What is RAD?

Real Awesome Development (or RAD) is a framework for WordPress development that
makes developing totally custom sites simple by heavily exploiting action hooks
in all the parent theme code. An override in a template is as simple as removing
a hook and throwing another in its place.

It is inspired by the ideas expressed in the electronic book [Radical WordPress](http://radicalwordpress.com).
I was writing a lot of what I thought and believed about WordPress site
development and thought it seemed like a great idea to make a companion suite of
software to use in future sites. RAD is meant to be easily updatable and
extendable so as to always follow the best practices of website development and
WordPress capability.

## What are all these comments?

In lieu of code, there are places where there are notes or comments. These are
meant to be placeholders for real code in the future. Rather than leave notes in
an abstract TODO or notes file, I'd rather they be part of the living codebase
for now. RAD is meant to be heavily commented though. You're going to be
developing on child themes anyway, so don't worry about it, it's only for
documentation purposes.
