An override in a template is as simple as removing\r\na hook and throwing another in its place.\r\n\r\nIt is inspired by the ideas expressed in the electronic book [Radical WordPress](http://radicalwordpress.com).\r\nI was writing a lot of what I thought and believed about WordPress site\r\ndevelopment and thought it seemed like a great idea to make a companion suite of\r\nsoftware to use in future sites. RAD is meant to be easily updatable and\r\nextendable so as to always follow the best practices of website development and\r\nWordPress capability.\r\n\r\n## What are all these comments?\r\n\r\nIn lieu of code, there are places where there are notes or comments. These are\r\nmeant to be placeholders for real code in the future. Rather than leave notes in\r\nan abstract TODO or notes file, I'd rather they be part of the living codebase\r\nfor now. RAD is meant to be heavily commented though. You're going to be\r\ndeveloping on child themes anyway, so don't worry about it, it's only for\r\ndocumentation purposes.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
